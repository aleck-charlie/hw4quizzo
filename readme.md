Currently unable to get answer check function to console log or work with to button clicks. Previously was able to create a console log and alert, but unable to move past that

Event listeners for answer button clicks from previous draft where buttons were coded into HTML. I know that they are needed for hidden buttons but not sure how to connect them now that they are hidden.

Event listeners for hide start button also from previous draft, not functioning

No init function yet, wondering if thats causing any problems
